# Dify Security Best Practices

This document outlines security best practices for deploying and operating Dify in both development and production environments.

## API Keys and Secrets Management

### Local Development

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Store all API keys and secrets in the `.env` file
   - Never commit the `.env` file to version control (it's included in `.gitignore`)
   - Use `.env.template` as a reference, but never include actual secrets in it

2. **Rotation**
   - Regularly rotate API keys and secrets
   - Update the `.env` file after rotation

### Production (AWS)

1. **AWS Secrets Manager**
   - Store sensitive information in AWS Secrets Manager
   - Reference secrets in ECS task definitions using the `secrets` field
   - Example:
     ```json
     "secrets": [
       {
         "name": "OPENAI_API_KEY",
         "valueFrom": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:account:secret:dify/openai-api-key"
       }
     ]
     ```

2. **IAM Roles**
   - Use IAM roles for service-to-service authentication
   - Implement the principle of least privilege
   - Regularly audit and rotate IAM credentials

3. **Key Rotation**
   - Implement automated key rotation using AWS Secrets Manager rotation functions
   - Set up alerts for expiring secrets

## Network Security

### Local Development

1. **Firewall**
   - Use a local firewall to restrict access to development ports
   - Only expose necessary ports (e.g., 3000 for web UI, 5001 for API)

2. **HTTPS**
   - Even in development, consider using HTTPS with self-signed certificates
   - Configure Nginx to use SSL in the development environment

### Production (AWS)

1. **VPC Configuration**
   - Deploy all resources within a VPC
   - Use private subnets for databases and internal services
   - Use public subnets only for load balancers and bastion hosts

2. **Security Groups**
   - Implement restrictive security groups
   - Allow only necessary traffic between services
   - Regularly audit security group rules

3. **Load Balancer**
   - Terminate SSL at the load balancer
   - Configure security headers at the load balancer level
   - Implement AWS WAF for additional protection

4. **CloudFront**
   - Use CloudFront for content delivery
   - Enable HTTPS-only communication
   - Configure appropriate cache policies

## Database Security

### Local Development

1. **Strong Passwords**
   - Use strong, unique passwords for database access
   - Store passwords securely in the `.env` file

2. **Regular Backups**
   - Use the provided backup scripts to regularly backup your database
   - Test restore procedures periodically

### Production (AWS)

1. **RDS Security**
   - Enable encryption at rest for RDS instances
   - Use AWS KMS for managing encryption keys
   - Enable automated backups with appropriate retention periods

2. **Access Control**
   - Restrict database access to application servers only
   - Use IAM authentication for RDS when possible
   - Implement database-level access controls

3. **Monitoring**
   - Enable RDS enhanced monitoring
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms for suspicious activities
   - Regularly review database logs

## Application Security

### General Practices

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Sanitize data before processing

2. **Authentication**
   - Implement multi-factor authentication for admin access
   - Use secure session management
   - Set appropriate token expiration times

3. **Authorization**
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Validate permissions for all API endpoints
   - Regularly audit user permissions

4. **Logging**
   - Implement comprehensive logging
   - Store logs securely
   - Set up log retention policies

### Container Security

1. **Image Security**
   - Use official base images
   - Regularly update container images
   - Scan images for vulnerabilities

2. **Runtime Security**
   - Run containers with minimal privileges
   - Implement resource limits
   - Use read-only file systems where possible

3. **Secrets in Containers**
   - Never build secrets into container images
   - Inject secrets at runtime
   - Use environment variables or mounted secrets

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection

1. **Personal Data**
   - Identify and classify personal data
   - Implement appropriate protection measures
   - Consider data residency requirements

2. **Data Retention**
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Provide mechanisms for data deletion
   - Document data flows

### Audit and Monitoring

1. **Access Logs**
   - Maintain comprehensive access logs
   - Implement log analysis tools
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities

2. **Regular Audits**
   - Conduct regular security audits
   - Review access permissions
   - Test incident response procedures

## Incident Response

1. **Preparation**
   - Develop an incident response plan
   - Define roles and responsibilities
   - Document contact information

2. **Detection**
   - Implement monitoring and alerting
   - Set up automated detection mechanisms
   - Train team members on identifying security incidents

3. **Response**
   - Contain the incident
   - Investigate the cause
   - Implement remediation measures

4. **Recovery**
   - Restore from backups if necessary
   - Verify system integrity
   - Document lessons learned

## Regular Updates

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Monitor security advisories
   - Implement automated dependency scanning

2. **System Updates**
   - Keep operating systems and software up to date
   - Plan and test updates before deployment
   - Maintain a rollback plan
